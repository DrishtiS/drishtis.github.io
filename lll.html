LA LA LAND<br>
Director - Damien Chazelle<br>
Cast - Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone<br>
Rating - &starf;&starf;&starf;&starf;&starf;<br>

They say the world is dying. They say movies are dead. And they say movie musicals are definitely dead. But there is a cure to this savagery; there is an antidote to this absurdity. It is a movie. It is a musical. It is a musical about movies. It’s called La La Land and it is here to save your life.
But it won’t come to you. You must go to it. You have been wronged far too often, I know; the movies have wronged us all. They have stood us up, left us alone on rainy curbs, but you must put your faith in them, one last time, if only to restore it. You must run to La La Land.
